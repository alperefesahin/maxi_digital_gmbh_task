* For the architecture, DDD (domain driven design) used, and for the managing the state, used the BLoC. To get the data, Dio package preferred.
* There is a image (2nd one) below, and you should know that that is for the invite button. In the UI there were 2 users and 1 button, but as you said in the mail, in the service there are 3 users, and to show the "invite button" after the users, I got a screenshot when I scroll it, and uploaded it below.
